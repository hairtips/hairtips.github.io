<p>Okay, so i never realized how much kpop idols mess with their hair until i started paying attention to each member�s hair every performance. It completely depends on the company. I’ve noticed that in a group, there’s always that member that rarely ever dyes her hair (ie jennie, nayeon, jungkook) and the member that almost always has a different hair color every comeback (ie jimin, taeyong). When it comes to the idols sharing their own opinions regarding their hairstyle and hair color, the hairstylists explain that some don�t have much of a say in it. Commonly, many kpop idols dye their hair with bold and bright colors. For some pinays and a few fanboys, they could go as far as dyeing their hair with a crazy color to channel the hallyu star they stan!</p>
